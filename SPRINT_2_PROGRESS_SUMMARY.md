## Issues Fixed Today (Sprint 2)

### ISSUE-008: Replace Print Statements with Proper Logging âœ…

**Problem:** 43 print() statements scattered across services made debugging and log control difficult.

**Solution:**
- Added `logging` module to all 5 service files
- Created module-level loggers: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Replaced all print statements with appropriate log levels:
  - `logger.debug()` - Cleanup operations, detailed diagnostics
  - `logger.info()` - Progress updates, completion messages
  - `logger.warning()` - Non-fatal failures (e.g., search errors)

**Files Modified:**
- `podknow/services/discovery.py` - 2 replacements
- `podknow/services/analysis.py` - 30+ replacements
- `podknow/services/rss.py` - 1 replacement
- `podknow/services/transcription.py` - 8 replacements
- `podknow/services/workflow.py` - 5 replacements

**Benefits:**
- Professional logging infrastructure
- Can configure log levels per module
- Log output can be redirected to files
- Better production debugging

**Time:** 1.5 hours

---

### ISSUE-009: Extract Magic Numbers to Named Constants âœ…

**Problem:** Hard-coded values (2.0, 12, 50, etc.) scattered throughout code reduced maintainability.

**Solution:**
Added 6 new constants to `podknow/constants.py`:
```python
# Transcription Settings
PARAGRAPH_TIME_GAP_THRESHOLD = 2.0
DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_DETECTION_SKIP_MINUTES = 2.0
LANGUAGE_DETECTION_SAMPLE_DURATION = 30.0

# Discovery Settings
ITUNES_API_MAX_LIMIT = 200
SPOTIFY_API_MAX_LIMIT = 50

# ID Generation
EPISODE_ID_HASH_LENGTH = 12
```

**Updated Files:**
- `podknow/constants.py` - Added 6 constants with documentation
- `podknow/services/transcription.py` - 3 replacements
- `podknow/services/rss.py` - 1 replacement
- `podknow/services/discovery.py` - 2 replacements

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for tunable parameters
- Easy to find and modify configuration values
- Clear documentation of what each value controls
- Reduced risk of inconsistent values

**Time:** 1 hour

---

### ISSUE-013: String Formatting Inconsistency âœ…

**Problem:** Needed to ensure consistent use of f-strings throughout codebase and enforce this standard going forward.

**Solution:**
- Verified all 100+ Python files already use f-strings consistently
- Only 2 legitimate `.format()` calls remain (for template substitution in config.py)
- Enhanced linting configuration with explicit f-string enforcement rules
- Created comprehensive code style documentation

**Verification:**
- âœ… Zero % formatting patterns found
- âœ… Zero string concatenation for formatting
- âœ… All error messages use f-strings
- âœ… Template substitution correctly uses .format()

**Files Modified:**
- `pyproject.toml` - Added RUF rules and f-string enforcement comments
- `CODE_STYLE.md` (NEW) - Comprehensive string formatting guidelines

**Linting Rules Added:**
- UP031: Enforces format specifiers over % format
- UP032: Enforces f-strings over .format() calls
- UP034: Enforces f-strings over % formatting

**Benefits:**
- Consistent code style across entire codebase
- Future-proofed with automated linting
- Clear guidelines for contributors
- Better IDE support and type checking

**Time:** 1 hour

---

### ISSUE-010: Reduce Coupling Between Workflow and Service Internals âœ…

**Problem:** WorkflowOrchestrator was calling private method `_generate_filename()` from TranscriptionService, breaking encapsulation.

**Solution:**
- Renamed `_generate_filename()` to `generate_filename()` (made public)
- Updated call in workflow.py to use public method
- Updated test to use public method name

**Files Modified:**
- `podknow/services/transcription.py` - Method renamed to public API
- `podknow/services/workflow.py` - Updated method call
- `tests/test_transcription_service.py` - Updated test

**Benefits:**
- Proper encapsulation - no private method access
- Clear public API for TranscriptionService
- Easier to refactor internal implementation
- Better testability

**Time:** 15 minutes

---

### ISSUE-011: Weak Audio File Format Validation âœ…

**Problem:** Only checked MIME types and extensions, not actual audio content. Corrupted files could waste processing time.

**Solution:**
- Added `_validate_audio_file()` method using librosa
- Validates audio can be decoded by loading first second
- Checks sample rate and audio data validity
- Gracefully handles missing librosa
- Integrated into download workflow

**Implementation:**
```python
def _validate_audio_file(self, file_path: str) -> bool:
    try:
        import librosa
        y, sr = librosa.load(file_path, duration=1.0, sr=None, mono=True)

        if len(y) == 0 or sr == 0:
            raise AudioProcessingError("Invalid audio file")

        return True
    except ImportError:
        logger.warning("librosa not available, skipping validation")
        return True
```

**Files Modified:**
- `podknow/services/transcription.py` - Added validation method
- `tests/test_transcription_service.py` - Updated mocks

**Benefits:**
- Early detection of corrupted files
- Saves processing time on invalid audio
- Fast validation (1 second sample)
- Graceful degradation without librosa

**Time:** 1 hour

---

### ISSUE-012: Language Detection Requirement Not Enforced Per PRD âœ…

**Problem:** PRD said "English only" but CLI had `--skip-language-detection` flag, creating inconsistency.

**Solution:**
- Chose Option B: Update PRD to match implementation (more flexible)
- Updated PRD to reflect default language detection with optional skip
- Documented that language detection is default but can be bypassed

**Change in prd.md:**
- **Before:** "if the language is 'english' only"
- **After:** "By default, detect and verify the language is English before transcribing (this can be skipped with a flag if needed)"

**Files Modified:**
- `prd.md` - Updated language requirement

**Decision Rationale:**
- More flexible for users who know content is English
- Better UX - no forced unnecessary processing
- Keeps existing CLI interface intact
- Aligns with modern tool design

**Time:** 30 minutes
