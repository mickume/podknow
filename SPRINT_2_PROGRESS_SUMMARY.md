## Issues Fixed Today (Sprint 2)

### ISSUE-008: Replace Print Statements with Proper Logging âœ…

**Problem:** 43 print() statements scattered across services made debugging and log control difficult.

**Solution:**
- Added `logging` module to all 5 service files
- Created module-level loggers: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- Replaced all print statements with appropriate log levels:
  - `logger.debug()` - Cleanup operations, detailed diagnostics
  - `logger.info()` - Progress updates, completion messages
  - `logger.warning()` - Non-fatal failures (e.g., search errors)

**Files Modified:**
- `podknow/services/discovery.py` - 2 replacements
- `podknow/services/analysis.py` - 30+ replacements
- `podknow/services/rss.py` - 1 replacement
- `podknow/services/transcription.py` - 8 replacements
- `podknow/services/workflow.py` - 5 replacements

**Benefits:**
- Professional logging infrastructure
- Can configure log levels per module
- Log output can be redirected to files
- Better production debugging

**Time:** 1.5 hours

### ISSUE-009: Extract Magic Numbers to Named Constants âœ…

**Problem:** Hard-coded values (2.0, 12, 50, etc.) scattered throughout code reduced maintainability.

**Solution:**
Added 6 new constants to `podknow/constants.py`:
```python
# Transcription Settings
PARAGRAPH_TIME_GAP_THRESHOLD = 2.0
DEFAULT_LANGUAGE_DETECTION_SKIP_MINUTES = 2.0
LANGUAGE_DETECTION_SAMPLE_DURATION = 30.0

# Discovery Settings
ITUNES_API_MAX_LIMIT = 200
SPOTIFY_API_MAX_LIMIT = 50

# ID Generation
EPISODE_ID_HASH_LENGTH = 12
```

**Updated Files:**
- `podknow/constants.py` - Added 6 constants with documentation
- `podknow/services/transcription.py` - 3 replacements
- `podknow/services/rss.py` - 1 replacement
- `podknow/services/discovery.py` - 2 replacements

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for tunable parameters
- Easy to find and modify configuration values
- Clear documentation of what each value controls
- Reduced risk of inconsistent values

**Time:** 1 hour

---

### ISSUE-013: String Formatting Inconsistency âœ…

**Problem:** Needed to ensure consistent use of f-strings throughout codebase and enforce this standard going forward.

**Solution:**
- Verified all 100+ Python files already use f-strings consistently
- Only 2 legitimate `.format()` calls remain (for template substitution in config.py)
- Enhanced linting configuration with explicit f-string enforcement rules
- Created comprehensive code style documentation

**Verification:**
- âœ… Zero % formatting patterns found
- âœ… Zero string concatenation for formatting
- âœ… All error messages use f-strings
- âœ… Template substitution correctly uses .format()

**Files Modified:**
- `pyproject.toml` - Added RUF rules and f-string enforcement comments
- `CODE_STYLE.md` (NEW) - Comprehensive string formatting guidelines

**Linting Rules Added:**
- UP031: Enforces format specifiers over % format
- UP032: Enforces f-strings over .format() calls
- UP034: Enforces f-strings over % formatting

**Benefits:**
- Consistent code style across entire codebase
- Future-proofed with automated linting
- Clear guidelines for contributors
- Better IDE support and type checking

**Time:** 1 hour
