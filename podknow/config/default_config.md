# PodKnow Configuration

This is the default configuration file for PodKnow. Copy this file to `~/.podknow/config.md` and customize it according to your needs.

## API Keys

```yaml
claude_api_key: "your-claude-api-key-here"
spotify_client_id: "your-spotify-client-id"  # Optional
spotify_client_secret: "your-spotify-client-secret"  # Optional
```

## Analysis Prompts

### Summary Prompt

```
Analyze this podcast transcription and provide a concise summary in 2-3 paragraphs. 
Focus on the main points, key insights, and overall theme of the episode. 
Be objective and informative, highlighting the most important takeaways for readers.
Avoid speculation and stick to what was actually discussed in the episode.
```

### Topic Extraction Prompt

```
Extract the main topics discussed in this podcast episode. 
List each topic in one sentence that captures the essence of what was discussed about that topic.
Focus on substantial topics that received meaningful discussion time.
Return only the topic sentences, one per line, without numbering or bullets.
Aim for 3-8 topics depending on the episode length and content diversity.
```

### Keyword Identification Prompt

```
Identify relevant keywords and tags for this podcast content. 
Focus on specific terms, concepts, people, companies, technologies, or methodologies mentioned.
Include both explicit mentions and implicit themes that would help categorize this content.
Return only the keywords separated by commas, without explanations.
Prioritize terms that would be useful for search and categorization.
```

### Sponsor Detection Prompt

```
Identify any sponsored content or advertisements in this transcription. 
Look for promotional language, product endorsements, discount codes, or clear advertising segments.
Pay attention to phrases like "this episode is sponsored by", "thanks to our sponsor", 
discount codes, special offers, or obvious product promotions.

For each sponsor segment found, provide:
1. The starting text (first few words where the sponsor content begins)
2. The ending text (last few words where the sponsor content ends)  
3. A confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how certain you are this is sponsored content

Return the results in JSON format with this structure:
[{"start_text": "...", "end_text": "...", "confidence": 0.95}]

If no sponsor content is found, return an empty array: []

Be conservative - only mark content as sponsored if you're reasonably confident it's promotional.
```

## Configuration File Setup

To use this configuration:

1. Create the PodKnow configuration directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.podknow
   ```

2. Copy this file to your configuration directory:
   ```bash
   cp podknow/config/default_config.md ~/.podknow/config.md
   ```

3. Edit the configuration file with your API keys and preferences:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.podknow/config.md
   ```

4. Set your Claude API key (required for analysis):
   - Get an API key from https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Add it to the `claude_api_key` field in the configuration
   - Or set the `CLAUDE_API_KEY` environment variable

5. Optionally set Spotify credentials for enhanced podcast discovery:
   - Create a Spotify app at https://developer.spotify.com/
   - Add the client ID and secret to the configuration
   - Or set `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables

## Environment Variables

PodKnow supports these environment variables as alternatives to configuration file settings:

- `CLAUDE_API_KEY`: Claude API key for analysis
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: Spotify app client ID
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: Spotify app client secret
- `PODKNOW_OUTPUT_DIR`: Default output directory
- `PODKNOW_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- `PODKNOW_LOG_FILE`: Log file path

Environment variables take precedence over configuration file settings.

## Customizing Prompts

The analysis prompts can be customized to match your specific needs:

### For Academic Research
- Modify the summary prompt to focus on methodology and findings
- Adjust topic extraction to identify research themes
- Customize keywords to include academic terminology

### For Business Analysis  
- Update prompts to focus on business insights and strategies
- Include industry-specific terminology in keyword extraction
- Modify sponsor detection for business partnership identification

### For Content Creation
- Adjust summary style for audience engagement
- Focus topic extraction on content themes and narratives
- Customize keywords for content categorization and SEO

## Troubleshooting Configuration

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**
   - Verify the key is correct and has proper permissions
   - Check if the key is properly quoted in YAML
   - Ensure no extra spaces or characters

2. **File Paths Not Working**
   - Use absolute paths or proper tilde expansion
   - Ensure directories exist and are writable
   - Check file permissions

3. **Prompts Not Loading**
   - Verify YAML syntax is correct
   - Check for proper indentation
   - Ensure prompt blocks are properly formatted

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Adjust `max_tokens` for faster responses
   - Increase `retry_delay` for rate limiting
   - Reduce `max_analysis_length` for large files

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with configuration:

1. Run PodKnow with `--verbose` flag for detailed logging
2. Check the log file for specific error messages
3. Verify all required dependencies are installed
4. Ensure API keys have proper permissions and quotas
