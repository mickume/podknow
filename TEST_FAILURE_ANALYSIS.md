## 🔴 CRITICAL: Confirmed Issues from Static Analysis

### ISSUE-002 CONFIRMED: Missing AnalysisError Import

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_cli.py::TestTranscribeCommand::test_transcribe_missing_claude_key
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIAnalyzeCommand::test_analyze_command_success
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIAnalyzeCommand::test_analyze_command_missing_key
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIAnalyzeCommand::test_analyze_command_file_not_found
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIAnalyzeCommand::test_analyze_command_invalid_transcription
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIAnalyzeCommand::test_analyze_command_api_error
```

**Error Message:**
```
NameError: name 'AnalysisError' is not defined
```

**Impact:** All `analyze` command tests fail due to missing import
**Location:** `podknow/cli/main.py:520`
**Fix:** Add `from ..exceptions import AnalysisError` to imports

**This confirms ISSUE-002 from the work breakdown is a real, critical bug.**

## 🟡 NEW ISSUE: Topic Validation Too Strict

### ISSUE-025: Analysis Service Requires Topics

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_analysis_service.py::TestAnalysisService::test_generate_markdown_output_with_sponsors
Error: Failed to analyze transcription: At least one topic is required
```

**Problem:**
The `AnalysisResult` model appears to require at least one topic, but Claude API might return empty topic lists for very short transcriptions or when parsing fails.

**Location:**
- `podknow/models/analysis.py` (likely in AnalysisResult dataclass)
- `podknow/services/analysis.py` (topic extraction)

**Proposed Solution:**
Make topics optional or allow empty list:
```python
@dataclass
class AnalysisResult:
    summary: str
    topics: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # Allow empty
    keywords: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    sponsor_segments: List[SponsorSegment] = field(default_factory=list)
```

**Severity:** 🟡 High
**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes

## 🟠 NEW ISSUE: CLI Integration Test Failures

### ISSUE-026: CLI Command Integration Problems

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLISearchCommand::test_search_command_success
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLISearchCommand::test_search_command_with_options
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLISearchCommand::test_search_command_network_error
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLISearchCommand::test_search_command_no_results
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIListCommand::test_list_command_success
```

**Problem:**
Multiple CLI integration tests are failing, suggesting that the CLI commands aren't properly integrated with the workflow orchestrator or that mock setups are incorrect.

**Root Causes:**
1. WorkflowOrchestrator not being called as expected
2. Error handling not matching test expectations
3. Mock objects not configured correctly for integration tests

**Investigation Needed:**
- Review how tests mock WorkflowOrchestrator
- Check if CLI commands properly instantiate workflow
- Verify error propagation from services to CLI

**Severity:** 🟠 Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 3 hours

---

## 🟠 NEW ISSUE: Setup Command Test Isolation

### ISSUE-027: Setup Command Fails Due to Existing Config

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLISetupCommands::test_setup_command_success
AssertionError: assert 'Configuration file created successfully' in
  'Configuration file already exists at: /Users/candlekeep/.podknow/config.md'
```

**Problem:**
The `setup` command test expects a fresh installation but finds an existing config file from previous runs or actual usage. Tests aren't properly isolated.

**Root Cause:**
Tests use the real user's home directory (`~/.podknow/config.md`) instead of a temporary directory.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. **Option A:** Update tests to use temporary directory:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def temp_config_dir(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    config_dir = tmp_path / ".podknow"
    monkeypatch.setenv("HOME", str(tmp_path))
    return config_dir
```

2. **Option B:** Add cleanup in test setup/teardown:
```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def clean_config():
    config_path = Path.home() / ".podknow" / "config.md"
    if config_path.exists():
        config_path.rename(config_path.with_suffix('.md.bak'))
    yield
    # Restore
```

3. **Option C:** Make ConfigManager accept config_path override

**Severity:** 🟠 Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

## 🟠 NEW ISSUE: Keyboard Interrupt Not Handled Correctly

### ISSUE-028: CLI Exit Codes Incorrect for Interrupts

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIErrorHandling::test_cli_keyboard_interrupt
assert 0 == 130
```

**Problem:**
When a KeyboardInterrupt occurs, the CLI should exit with code 130 (standard Unix convention), but it's returning 0 (success).

**Location:** `podknow/cli/main.py` (exception handler)

**Current Code:**
```python
elif isinstance(exc_value, KeyboardInterrupt):
    click.echo("\nOperation cancelled by user.", err=True)
    sys.exit(130)  # Code is correct, but not being reached
```

**Issue:**
The exception handler is set up but KeyboardInterrupt might be caught elsewhere or the hook isn't working properly in test environment.

**Proposed Solution:**
Verify exception handler is properly installed and test with actual signal handling:
```python
def cli(ctx, ...):
    # Set up exception handling
    sys.excepthook = handle_exception

    # Also handle signals directly
    import signal
    def signal_handler(signum, frame):
        sys.exit(130)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
```

**Severity:** 🟠 Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

---

## 🟠 NEW ISSUE: Error Exit Codes Not Set

### ISSUE-029: CLI Should Exit with Error Code on Failures

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIErrorHandling::test_cli_unexpected_error_verbose
assert 0 == 1
FAILED tests/test_cli_integration.py::TestCLIErrorHandling::test_cli_unexpected_error_normal
assert 0 == 1
```

**Problem:**
When errors occur, the CLI exits with code 0 (success) instead of 1 (error). This breaks shell scripting and CI/CD pipelines.

**Impact:**
- Scripts can't detect failures
- CI/CD doesn't know when builds fail
- Poor integration with automation tools

**Root Cause:**
Exceptions are caught but `sys.exit(1)` isn't called, or Click is suppressing the exit code.

**Proposed Solution:**
Ensure all error paths call `sys.exit(1)` or raise `SystemExit(1)`:
```python
except PodKnowError as e:
    click.echo(f"Error: {e}", err=True)
    sys.exit(1)  # Ensure exit code is set
```

**Severity:** 🟠 Medium (Important for automation)
**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

## 🔵 Test Infrastructure Issues

### ISSUE-030: Mock Setup Problems

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_analysis_service.py::TestClaudeAPIClient::test_send_message_empty_response_raises_error
FAILED tests/test_analysis_service.py::TestClaudeAPIClient::test_send_message_rate_limit_retry
FAILED tests/test_analysis_service.py::TestAnalysisService::test_init_with_api_key
FAILED tests/test_analysis_service.py::TestAnalysisService::test_get_default_prompts
```

**Problem:**
Mock objects not properly configured for some test scenarios, causing tests to fail even though the underlying code might be correct.

**Examples:**
1. Claude API client mock not returning expected response structure
2. ConfigManager mock not providing prompts correctly
3. Rate limit retry test not simulating retries properly

**Severity:** 🔵 Low (Test infrastructure, not production code)
**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

## 🔵 Audio Processing Test Issues

### ISSUE-031: Language Detection Tests Fail in Test Environment

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_transcription_service.py::TestLanguageDetection::test_english_language_detection
FAILED tests/test_transcription_service.py::TestLanguageDetection::test_non_english_language_rejection
FAILED tests/test_transcription_service.py::TestLanguageDetection::test_language_detection_mlx_error
Error: AudioProcessingError: Failed to create audio sample
```

**Problem:**
Tests for language detection fail because they can't create audio samples. This is likely due to:
1. Missing test audio files
2. librosa/soundfile not available in test environment
3. Mock audio data not in correct format

**Root Cause:**
Tests try to use real audio processing instead of mocking the audio loading.

**Proposed Solution:**
Mock the audio loading in tests:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_audio_data():
    """Provide mock audio data for testing."""
    import numpy as np
    # Create 1 second of audio at 16kHz
    sample_rate = 16000
    audio = np.random.randn(sample_rate)
    return audio, sample_rate

@patch('librosa.load')
def test_language_detection(mock_load, mock_audio_data):
    mock_load.return_value = mock_audio_data
    # Test logic
```

**Severity:** 🔵 Low (Test infrastructure)
**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

## 🔵 Workflow Test Issues

### ISSUE-032: Workflow Orchestrator Mock Issues

**Test Evidence:**
```
FAILED tests/test_workflow_integration.py::TestWorkflowOrchestrator::test_transcription_workflow_success
Error: TranscriptionError: Processing failed: object of type 'Mock' has no len()

FAILED tests/test_workflow_integration.py::TestWorkflowOrchestrator::test_transcription_workflow_language_error
AssertionError: Expected 'cleanup_audio_file' to have been called once. Called 0 times.
```

**Problem:**
1. Mock objects for workflow tests don't have proper methods/attributes
2. Cleanup not called in expected scenarios

**Root Cause:**
Integration tests for workflow need better mock setup to simulate the full workflow without actually downloading audio or calling APIs.

**Severity:** 🔵 Low (Test infrastructure)
**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

from ..exceptions import PodKnowError, NetworkError, AnalysisError
```

### 2. Make Topics Optional (5 minutes)
```python
# podknow/models/analysis.py
@dataclass
class AnalysisResult:
    summary: str
    topics: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    keywords: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    sponsor_segments: List[SponsorSegment] = field(default_factory=list)
```

### 3. Fix Exit Codes (10 minutes)
```python
# podknow/cli/main.py - In each command's except block
except PodKnowError as e:
